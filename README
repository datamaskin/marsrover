This test was for the thoughtworks hands-on test for employment but did not pass.

The target of the test was to allow file input of coordinates to move a Mars rover vehicle.

The test was very well designed and operates according to the instructions handed down by thoughtworks HR.

Thoughtworks HR would not give a reason as why the test was found unacceptable.

This is a test of git flow on a remote server
